Q1. Consider the model $Y = 5 - 2 x + \epsilon$

where $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2 = \frac{|x|}{4})$

That is $\text{Var}[Y \mid X = x] = \frac{|x|}{4}$

Calculate $P[Y > 1 \mid X = 3]$

```{r}
# Y = 5 -6 + \epsilon
# P(Y= -1 + epsilon)
# sigma = sqrt(3/4)
# Considering a normal distribution

hatvalues()
```
